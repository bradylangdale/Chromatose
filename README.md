# Chromatose
Capsher 2023 Python Game Competition
## Introduction
Chromatose is a first-person shooter where your goal is to survive as long as possible but with a twist. As hinted by in the name the game makes clever use of color, as you move, shoot, and take damage.

## Rules
You start with half of each color, shown by the bars in the bottom left corner. These colors correspond to your attributes:
- Red is health, don't let it drop down or the game is over
- Green is ammo, you need this to kill the enemies
- Blue is shield, this is a great way to fling enemies far away from the player to get some personal space

Your job is to kill as many enemies as possible, every time you kill one, it will drop a crystal that you can use to replenish that color. 

The game's enemy count and damage scales as your score increases, How long can you survive?
